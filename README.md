## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with based on Python versions 3.*. The following packages are needed: statsmodels, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This repo contains notes from Coursera class `Data Analysis Tools` by Westleyan University. The class discussed topics including sample to population, hypothesis testing, and how to choose a statistical test. The bivariate statistical tools could be ANOVA, Chi-Square, and correlation coefficient.

1. For categorical explanatory variable and quantitative response variable, we should use an Analysis of Variance, ANOVA as our inferential test.
2. For both categorical variables, we should use Chi Square Test of independence as the inferential test.
3. For both quantitative variables, we should use correlation coefficient as the inferential test
4. For quantitative explanatory variable and categorical response variable, we should categorize the explanatory variable with two levels, and then use the Chi-Square Test of independence as the inferential test.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The data file `nesarc` and `marscrater_pds` could be downloaed from Courseara.
The notebook is exploratory with titles and sections to showcase work relatd to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The purpose of the repo is to summarize Python methods to handle bivariate statistical analysis. No formal results are included.
